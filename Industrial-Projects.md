**Tourism Knowledge Graph** 
Social media is used to treat time and encourages travel. People in social media are improving social relations and evaluating free times.
For instance, people on Instagram made a plan for leisure preferences; They follow the influencers "that live their dreams". People are producing content about their interests through comments, stories, and posts. They are affected by other users and decide on their vacation; then, they use the other travelling social networks like the Trip advisor site to implement their plans. As a result, An algorithm based on Information Retrieval methods designed and developed to predict and visualize people’s decisions around the "Tourism" concept to help tourist services companies that could detect user’s behaviour for their long term strategic plans.

**AI assisstant as a Recommender System**
One of the popular application of AI is a question and answer system, Lately I was working on a q&s machine in insurance industry. In the first place, I used [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/transformers/usage.html) to extract question and answer as the dataset, the result was awful, so annoutated by human. I used [Rasa] (https://rasa.com/)for MVP, and for product I used [Keras](https://faroit.com/keras-docs/1.1.1/)
