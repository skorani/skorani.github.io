 **About me**
 
 Since 2013, I have been immersed in the field of Computer Science, specializing in natural language processing and machine learning. Growing up in Iran, a country shaped by deep ideologies, I found myself drawn to profound philosophical questionsâ€”most notably, "How do I live my life, my way?"

This curiosity led me on a journey of self-discovery through diverse cultures, languages, music, cinema, and dance. It was an exploration that shaped my perspective and reinforced my belief that personal growth comes from embracing new experiences. Ultimately, my path led me to technology, where I found both passion and purpose.

Throughout my career, I have designed and developed several AI-driven solutions, culminating in the creation of Tripoh.ie, an AI-powered platform revolutionizing travel experiences.
