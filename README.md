 **About me**
 
I have been working in the Computer Science field since 2013, specializing in natural language processing and machine learning. Before pursuing this career, growing up in Iran, a country shaped by deep ideologies, I was driven by philosophical questions, searching for the answer to my core question: "How do I live my life, my way?"

This quest took me on a journey through different cultures, places, music, cinema, dance and languages. It was a personal exploration that I believe everyone should experience to truly find themselves. Ultimately, my path led me to technology, where I found both my passion and purpose.

Over the years, I have designed and developed several AI-based solutions, culminating in the founding of [Tripoh.ie](https://tripoh.ie), an AI-powered platform transforming travel experiences.
