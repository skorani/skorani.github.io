 I have been working in Computer Science field since 2013, working in a comprehensive range of social network analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning problems. Before choosing the computer science field as my career, I was a young woman in an ideological country like Iran my mind was full of philosophical questions. I tried to find myself and answer my primary enigma, "Living my life, my way." I started my journey among people, places, songs, movies, dancing, sports, and languages. I need that journey, and I believe everybody needs the journey. Finally found my way into tech. I designed and developed a Tourism Knowledge Graph, an AI assistant, and many NLP tools. After a while, I get back to academia. Right now, I am a Natural Language Processing Ph.D. student at [Insight Centre](https://www.insight-centre.org/) in Unit for Natural Language Processing [NUI Galway](https://www.nuigalway.ie/). For my research, I am working on Distributed Knowledge Graph and low resource language. [Dr. John McCrae](https://john.mccr.ae/) is my supervisor.
