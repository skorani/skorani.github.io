 **About me**
 
 I have been working in the Computer Science field since 2013, working on natural language processing, and machine learning problems. Before choosing the computer science field for my career, as a young woman in an ideological country like Iran, my mind was full of philosophical questions. I tried to find myself and answer my primary enigma, "Living my life, my way." I started my journey among people, places, songs, movies, dances, sports, and languages. I need that journey, and I believe everybody needs the journey. Finally found my way into tech. I designed and developed many AI-based software, After a while, I have decided to get back to academia. Right now, I am a Natural Language Processing Ph.D. student at [Insight Centre](https://www.insight-centre.org/people#researchers_section) in the Unit for Linguistic Data. I am working on distributed knowledge graph and [Dr. John McCrae](https://john.mccr.ae/) is my supervisor.
