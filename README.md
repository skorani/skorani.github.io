I have been working in Computer Science field since 2013, working in a comprehensive range of social network analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning problems. Before choosing the computer science field for my career as a young woman in an ideological country like Iran my mind was full of philosophical questions. I tried to find myself and answer, my primary enigma, "Living my life, my way". I started my journey among people, places, songs, movies, dancing, sports, and languages. I need that journey, and I believe everybody needs a journey, finally found my way into tech. I designed and developed a Tourism Knowledge Graph, also, desined and developed an AI assisstant.Right now I am a natural language processing phD student at [Insight Centre](https://www.insight-centre.org/) in Unit for Natural Language Processing [NUI Galway](https://www.nuigalway.ie/)
